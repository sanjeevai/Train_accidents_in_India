## Project Overview

Train is the most common mode of travel for long distance journey in India. This year India has seen major accidents in railways due to several factors including natural causes and human error. We have tried to study the causes of train accidents for year 2002-2017, and other factors which trigger train accidents in different parts of the country. This report includes major accidents till 2017 which impacted the customer experience or say made it unsafe to travel in train.

## Data

Data was collected from various news websites, online news archives, Wikipedia articles, etc. Data was available on the internet from year 1890-2017 but analysis is carried out for 2002- 2017 because news reports on many old incidents needed citations and some of them were reported in less detail on news websites. To cover major features affecting the accident rate in India and to closely compare them, 2002-2017 year range provided enough observations (114) to make some statistical conclusion.
